Transport is currently the highest emitting sector of the UK economy, accounting for 22% of greenhouse gas emissions. Unfortunately, the high costs and limited supplies of suitable batteries have stunted the potential expansion of the electric vehicle market. The UK intended to champion this area, committing to developing the GBP3.8 billion ($4.4 billion) Britishvolt gigafactory, a pioneering example of British industrys progression away from fossil fuel reliance.

But, in part because of their names, the average person likely doesnt know that BQ.1 is related to BA.5, Hotez says.
